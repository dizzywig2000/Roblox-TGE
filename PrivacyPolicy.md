About This Privacy Policy
-------------------------

This Privacy Policy is designed to inform the user how their online data is stored, used, and distributed.
We value user safety and privacy, and this document will explain how we securely store data and use it in our applications.  

This policy will explain the rights you have to control your data, and how you can manage it.
Here is a list of our basic principles:

- **We value privacy.** We strive to be a safe place for users to connect, play, and have fun in our games.
- **We don't sell data.** Your data is never sold to third parties, and is only transmitted when necessary (e.g, games).
- **You're in charge.** The only data collected is required data for use in our games and servers. You can request data deletion at any time to completely erase all your data from our servers.

### Where This Policy Applies

This policy applies to all applications and experiences offered by official sources.  

Official sources include, but may not be limited to:
  - The official *The Galactic Empire* [Roblox Group](https://www.roblox.com/communities/14619194/The-Galactic-Empire#!/about)
  - The official *Imperial Moderation* Discord Bot

If you suspect your data was sent to a source not covered by this document (e.g, a phishing site/scam), contact our support.
Details on opening a support issue can be found [here](#general-privacy-support).  

Please also note that only data collected and used by our own servers is covered in this policy. Please review the [Roblox Privacy Policy](https://www.roblox.com/info/privacy) and the [Discord Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) for information on how those sites use and distribute your data.

---

Data We Collect
---------------

We collect only what is required for providing you services in our servers and games. This includes:

### Data You Provide

Data that you provide includes, but is not limited to:

- Data you enter directly into our applications (e.g, when you update your group profile)
- Data relating to moderator actions taken against you (e.g, the reason you were banned, kicked, muted, etc.)
- Other data provided directly to us, such as when you do certain actions in the TGEBOT management panel, etc.

### Data We Automatically Collect

Data that we process automatically includes, but is not limited to:

- **Information about your device.** When you visit websites operated by us, we process certain things such as your operating system, browser, etc. Only information required for use is stored on our servers.

### Data We Collect From Third Parties

We collect information about your Roblox and Discord accounts whenever you do actions in our games and servers. For example, we store how many 'credits' you have in our game, or how many 'points' you have in our groups.

---

How We Use Your Data
--------------------

Your data is used only for operations in our community. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Roblox games (e.g, saving the ammount of credits you have in-game)
- Discord Servers (e.g, logging moderator actions against you, checking roles, etc.)

Your data is **never** sold to third parties for any reason.  
Your data is, however, sent to certain third parties for specific purposes. This includes:

- **Roblox games.** Your game data is sent to games you join, so your credits, inventory, etc. are saved across sessions.

---

How We Store Data
-----------------

All user data is encrypted and stored on secure servers. Raw data is never sent anywhere outside of internal channels.

---

Data Removal
------------

To remove your data from our servers for any reason, see below:

- To file a GDPR "right to erasure" request, send the `/erase` command directly to the *Imperial Moderation*[^3] bot's Direct Messages. More information can be found [here](#right-to-erasure-requests).
- You can open a support issue and request for your data to be removed. Details on opening a support issue can be found [here](#general-privacy-support).

---

Privacy Policy Updates
----------------------

We may update this policy at any time, and elements may be changed, added, or removed.  
When the policy is updated, all users with stored data will be sent a message directing them to the new policy.

---

Support
-------

See the sections below for how you can get support for issues regarding privacy.

### General Privacy Support

If you have questions or concerns, you can E-Mail the privacy team at [tgeoperationhelp@gmail.com](mailto:tgeoperationhelp@gmail.com)

### Right To Erasure Requests

Users have the right to submit a GDPR "right-to-erasure" request. To do so, send the `/erase` command directly to the TGE Bot. After the request is authenticated, there will be a "grace perioud" of two weeks where your data is still stored, but not available before permanent deletion. This allows you to cancel your erasure request before it's completed.  
Data that is deleted includes:

- Your game data
- Data we store relating to your Roblox account
- Data we store relating to your Discord account

Data that is **not** deleted includes:

- Data relating to moderator actions against you. (e.g, why you were banned, kicked, etc.)

Data not deleted from our servers does not include any personally-identifiable information and is thus exempt from GDPR "right-to-erasure"
